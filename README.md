WebDB, a database user-interface module for Kohana 3
================================================================================

WebDB is a database web interface aimed at non-technical users, providing simple
means to navigate and edit a database.  It is akin to phpMyAdmin, in that it
presents the data and structure of databases to the user for viewing and
modification, but where phpMyAdmin is a database administrator's tool, WebDB
tries to make things pretty and easy for users who are primarily interested in
the *data* (and not the schema).

__Dependencies:__

WebDB requires these additional Kohana 3 modules:
[Database](http://github.com/kohana/database);
[Pagination](http://github.com/kohana/pagination); and
[Auth](http://github.com/kohana/auth).
There are some pages for the [Userguide](http://github.com/kohana/userguide) as
well, if that module is installed.
