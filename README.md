# WebDB

## What is WebDB?

WebDB is a database web interface aimed at non-technical users, providing simple
means to navigate and edit a database.  It is akin to phpMyAdmin, in that it
presents the data and structure of databases to the user for viewing and
modification, but where phpMyAdmin is a database administrator's tool, WebDB
tries to make things pretty and easy for users who are primarily interested in
the *data* (and not the schema).  For example: field names are properly
capitalised and formatted; foreign keys are presented as links to their referenced
records; and edit form fields are all matched to their underlying data types to
make it as easy as possible to enter data.  Many other features make WebDB a
(hopefully) useful prototyping or bare-bones data base interface.

## Quick Start

1. Download and uncompress in a web-accessible location.

2. Copy `application/bootstrap.dist.php` to `application/bootstrap.php` and edit
   the basic configuration therein.

3. Copy the configuration files. The minimum is usually just `database.php`,
   but any others can also be copied and customized.

4. Set up database information and an authentication source:
   * Set username and password to NULL in `application/config/database.php`,
     and Auth driver to `'db'` in `application/config/auth.php`;
   * **Or** set all credentials in `application/config/database.php` and elect
     to use a different Auth driver (such as ORM or file) in
     `application/config/auth.php`.

   If you do the latter, you will also need to set up whatever else is required
   for your chosen Auth driver.

5. That's it! You can now log in.

## Schema Structure and Nomenclature

For its records be edited or viewed, tables need to have single-column primary
keys, with values that can be included in URLs. For example, autoincrementing
integers.

## Access Control

WebDB has a number of different options for user authentication and
authorisation. Credentials can be supplied from the Database configuration
file, user input, or elsewhere (such as an LDAP server) â€” and are generally a
combination of these. How they are combined, and what the options are for
further refining users' permissions, are detailed below.

* If valid connection details are provided in `application/config/database.php`
  then these will be used to connect to the database.  The user will at this
  point have all of the permissions of the database user.  Note that if the
  MySQL anonymous user (who has an empty username) is present, then its access
  will apply at this point.
* User authentication is handled by the Auth module, and so any drivers for that
  module can be used.  The DB driver (provided with WebDB) can be used to
  authenticate as MySQL users.
* If a valid MySQL user is given in the Database configuration file, and a
  driver other than DB is selected in the Auth configuration file, then users
  can authenticate against that other driver, and if logged in will have all of
  the permissions of the MySQL user.

## Other Features

* **Table and column comments** are displayed wherever appropriate.  For MySQL,
  column comments are limited to 255 characters, and table comments to only 60
  characters.
* **Foreign keys** are shown as links to their foreign rows, or (when being
  edited) as drop-down lists (either normal HTML ones, for short lists, or AJAX
  auto-complete ones, for longer lists).
* Users can **filter** by any column and a range of operations ('contains',
  'is empty', 'equals', etc.).  This includes searching foreign keys for values
  found in the 'title column' of the foreign table.
* The first non-primary unique key is used as a table's 'title column', and
  displayed wherever a table is referred to from another table (i.e. from a
  foreign key).
* An **import** feature allows data in CSV format to be brought into a database,
  undergoing required sanity-checking and transformation (for e.g. foreign keys)
  on the way.
