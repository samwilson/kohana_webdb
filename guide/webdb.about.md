# What is WebDB?

WebDB is a database web interface aimed at non-technical users, providing simple
means to navigate and edit a database.  It is akin to phpMyAdmin, in that it
presents the data and structure of databases to the user for viewing and
modification, but where phpMyAdmin is a database administrator's tool, WebDB
tries to make things pretty and easy for users who are primarily interested in
the *data* (and not the schema).  For example: field names are properly
capitalised and formatted; foreign keys are presented as links to their referenced
records; and edit form fields are all matched to their underlying data types to
make it as easy as possible to enter data.  Many other features make WebDB a
(hopefully) useful prototyping or bare-bones data base interface.

## Quick Start

1. Enable the module in `bootstrap.php`;
2. Set up authentication and authorization sources:
   1. Set username and password to NULL in `APPPATH/application/config/database.php`,
      and Auth driver to `'db'` in `APPPATH/application/config/auth.php`;
   2. **Or** set all credentials in `APPPATH/application/config/database.php`
      and elect to use a different Auth driver (such as ORM or file) in
      `APPPATH/application/config/auth.php`.

   If you do the latter, you will also need to set up whatever else is required
   for your chosen Auth driver.
3. That's it!  You can now log in, and unless you set up the additional
   WebDB-specific user authorization measures (described below), you will have
   complete access to view and modify everything.

## Access Control

WebDB has a number of different options for user authentication and
authorisation.  Credentials can be supplied from the Database configuration
file, user input, or elsewhere (such as an LDAP server) â€” and are generally a
combination of these.  How they are combined, and what the options are for
further refining users' permissions, are detailed below.

1. If valid connection details are provided in
   `APPPATH/application/config/database.php` then these will be used to connect
   to the database.
2. If not, the user will be prompted for a username and password and these will
   be used to connect.
3. If a connection is made with credentials from the configuration file, then it
   is most likely that there will be further application-level access control.
   At this point, a user can log in and have complete access to everything.
4. With the addition of the `permissions` table to the system, WebDB
   will run with full *table-* and *row-level* user permissions.  This means
   that an unauthenticated user will see nothing by default (unless the wildcard
  `*` is specified for some permissions), and the site administrator must
   explicitly grant all privileges.

[!!] More information about the permissions system will be coming soon.

The `permissions` table schema:

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `permissions` (
        `id`            int(5)       NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        `database_name` varchar(65)  NOT NULL DEFAULT '*' COMMENT 'A single database name, or an asterisk to denote all databases.',
        `table_name`    varchar(65)  NOT NULL DEFAULT '*' COMMENT 'A single table name, or an asterisk to denote all tables.',
        `column_names`  text  COMMENT 'A comma-delimited list of table columns, or an asterisk to denote all columns.',
        `where_clause`  varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'The SQL WHERE clause to use to determine row-level access.',
        `permission`    enum('*','select','insert','update','delete','import','export') NOT NULL DEFAULT '*' COMMENT 'The permission that is being assigned (the asterisk denotes all).',
        `identifier`    varchar(65)  NOT NULL DEFAULT '*' COMMENT 'A single database name, or asterisk to denote ALL databases.'
    ) COMMENT 'User permissions on databases, tables, and/or rows.';

## Other Features

* **Table and column comments** are displayed wherever appropriate.  For MySQL,
  column comments are limited to 255 characters, and table comments to only 60
  characters.
* **Foreign keys** are show as links to their foreign rows, or (when being edited)
  as autocomplete drop-down lists.
* Users can **filter** by any column and a range of operations ('contains',
  'is empty', 'equals', etc.).  This includes searching foreign keys for values
  found in the 'title column' of the foreign table.
